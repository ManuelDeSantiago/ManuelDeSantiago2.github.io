        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Manuel De Santiago. I am a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a first-year undergraduate and a first generation student. I am majoring in political science. I decided to study this course because of the interest that I had during junior year in my AP United States History class. Taking these courses in college is quite the challenge, and they are very difficult. No matter what however, I try my best to stay on top of my work and do the best that I can. I attend lectures almost every single day, take notes, and do my work on time. However, I end up with too much work, with some having a closer deadline. I still complete the majority of the assigned work, especially the ones that have an impact on my grades. If I am stuck on anything, I can go to office hours that my professor or TAâ€™s hold. Whenever there is an upcoming quiz, midterm, or final, I usually like to take a lot of time preparing myself and studying for those exams. I like to reach out for help from my TAâ€™s, discord servers from the class, and review the study guides that someone provides, which usually comes from the professor, or from other classmates, as well as creating my own and sharing it with others. When I donâ€™t succeed at something the first time, I like to discipline myself even more than I had before so that I make sure that I donâ€™t repeat the same failures. I like to plan and follow a schedule for the day to make sure that I get what needs to be done. I usually like to study during the afternoon, because I feel like I can be more concentrated than other times, meaning that I feel encouraged to get more work done. I also make sure that my courses throughout the quarter are neat so that I have days where I can get many things done, I do try to manage my time responsibly by making sure I have a time limit to myself to have fun on other things, such as social media, video games, walking or exercising, and other stuff. I do know that there are many resources on campus that help students with many things, such as homework, mental well being, study sessions and more, in which I try to use them when necessary. <br><br>
        There are many experiences that I have had throughout high school and college. One of the experiences that I have is communication skills. First of all, I am easy to communicate and talk with, I like to be helpful to others when I can. My biggest improvement on my communication skills is when I had an internship for my congressman during my senior year of high school. This was also one interest that brought me into studying political science. It was during the midterm elections of Fall, 2022, when my boss had the interns making calls to the registered voters in the 25th district of California so that we could get our representative to win the election. Not only did we make calls, but we also had a day when we tried to get supporters to vote for our candidate by knocking door-to-door. I would say that this helped me improve my communication skills because I learned how to answer calls, as well as dealing with voters that feel disturbed by the call, and I was able to make new friends in the internship. The other experience that I have had is being part of leadership clubs. I have been part of the Associated Student Body, also known as ASB, back in high school. I learned some things, like trying to be a leader, working as a cashier, and how things get done around the school. I was also in Link Crew, which helped freshmen navigate their way through their first year of high school. Currently, I am part of a club on campus called Residence Halls Association, also known for their short term RHA. I hold positions such as a spirit and recognition assistant, as well as a residence hall senator.<br><br>
        Additional stuff that I have is that I have joined the marching band during my freshman and senior year of high school. The experience was really fun as the band marched the show during football games and in competitions. Extra experience that I have is that I do my best to multitask. I am also bilingual, as I am able to speak both english and spanish. These two skills came well equipped as when I did my internship for my congressmen, I tried taking other interns' phone calls because some of the registered voters were spanish speakers. I tried my best with handling others' phone calls, as well as my own, but I was very hard working, and got the job done.
